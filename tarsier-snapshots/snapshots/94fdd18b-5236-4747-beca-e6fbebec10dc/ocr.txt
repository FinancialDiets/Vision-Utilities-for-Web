                [ 40 ] As a user, I may not want to be tied down to OpenAI. There are a lot of companies offering APIs for LLMs. We should
                explore what are the best, and provide an interface to select between them

                [ 52 ] did some initial analysis and it appears that AutoGPT uses Langchain in [ @ 55 ] chain.ts [ 53 ] to communicate with   [ 87 ] No milestone
                OpenAl. Since Langchain appears to offer support for other LLMS ( see e.g.
                [ @ 56 ] https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/master/langchain/llms [ 54 ] ) then a possible solution might be to
                parameterize the LLM ( s ) in chain.ts. Specific settings would have to be provided for supported LLM ( s ).                  [ 89 ] Development
