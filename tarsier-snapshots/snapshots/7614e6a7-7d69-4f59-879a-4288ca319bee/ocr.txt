   [ 25 ] Apply now >
                        [ 27 ] Our team brings OpenAl's most capable technology to the world
                        through our products. Most recently, we released ChatGPT, GPT - 4, the
                        Whisper API, and DALL - E. We empower consumers and developers alike to
                        use and access our start - of - the - art Al models, allowing them to do things
                        that they've never been able to before.
                        [ 28 ] Across all product lines, we ensure that these powerful tools are used
                        responsibly. This is a key part of OpenAl's path towards safely deploying
                        broadly beneficial Artificial General Intelligence ( AGI ). Safety is more
                        important to us than unfettered growth.

                        product teams to build a world - class model customization experience for
