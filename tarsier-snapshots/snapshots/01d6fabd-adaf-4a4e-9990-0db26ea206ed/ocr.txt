                                    [ 55 ] 2 ) How do you think being Unclassified for 1 term ( Jan 2012 ) - completing 12 prerequisite credits would look ... if I am planning on being accepted to a
                                    degree in May 2012?
                                     [ 56 ] Just put those credits towards my new degree?
                                     [ 57 ] Do you think this would hurt me ...
                                     [ 58 ] Anyone accepted been in a similar situation?

                                     [ 71 ] don't think that completing prerequisite courses as unclassified would necessarily make your application look bad. In that scenario you are at least
                                    studying a coherent line of school work. That part of the FAQ refers to individuals who primarily take" bird" courses to increase their GPA.
                                     [ 72 ] That being said, it's always good to email adcom and see what they think.
                                     [ 73 ] Good luck.

                                           Hi there;
                 A
                                     [ 81 ] In first year I did 8 courses, In second year I did 9 during the academic year ( and 1 during the summer ), and I did 9 in third year ( and 2 during the
            [ 76 ] Members          summer ).
             [ @ 77 ]   129
                                    [ 82 ] I had a reduced course load because I was dealing with serious family issues and then grieving the death of an immediate family member that I was very
                                    close to. Along with the grief I had symptoms of depression ( and this is well documented ).
                                     [ 83 ] However, I did manage to maintain a 95 % average / 3.99 GPA while taking rigorous courses.
                                     [ 84 ] Do you think I need to demonstrate 10 courses an academic year before applying to UBC?
                                     [ 85 ] I have a three - year BSc degree, and I am considering taking this next year away from university to gain extra - curricular experience and hopefully earn
                                    some money, but I am concerned that applying to UBC with no full - time years on my transcript may be hopeless.
                                     [ 86 ] Thanks for your input.

                                     [ 95 ] Are you IP? Yes, you should definitely give it a shot, don't worry too much about the full time thing. A person who averages 95 % in 8 and 9 courses isn't
                                    going to drop to a 60 % by taking 1 more course

                                     [ 102 ] I think you should contact UBC about whether or not they care about taking 24 or 27 credits rather than 30. I took 25 credits in 2nd year and ended up
                                    fine. A 95 % average is pretty ridiculous even for OOP let alone IP, so I think you should definitely apply.

                                     [ 111 ] guess my concerns about the reduced course load mostly stems from the fact that some of the other Canadian medical schools list a full - course load
                                    for at least one year as an absolute requirement, so I thought perhaps very few students with a reduced course load make it into UBC even though they state on
                                    their admission site that it is not technically necessary.
                                     [ 112 ] Anyways, I will take the advice of emailing UBC, and will later post their reply in here in case it is helpful for other students with similar concerns.
                                     [ 113 ] Thanks again.
