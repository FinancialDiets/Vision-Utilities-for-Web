                                      you'd be better off pursuing a new platform based on a cheaper modern motherboard. Energy
                                      consumption should be less as well, and you'd get benefits like SATA - 3 support, PCI - E 3.0

                                      [ 93 ] Most likely your X58 motherboard has USB3 and SATA6 functionality already anyway via
